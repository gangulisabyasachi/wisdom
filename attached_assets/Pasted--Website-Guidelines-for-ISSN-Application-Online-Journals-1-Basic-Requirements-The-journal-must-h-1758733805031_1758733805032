âœ… Website Guidelines for ISSN Application (Online Journals) 1. Basic Requirements The journal must have a valid URL (your own domain is preferable, not free subdomains like blogspot or wordpress.com). The site should clearly display: Journal title Publisherâ€™s name and full postal address (in India) Contact email (institutional domain preferred) ISSN (after it is assigned, clearly mention it with correct format). 2. Editorial Board Must have at least 5 Editorial Board Members. Editorial details must include: Full name Designation + Department Institutional affiliation Official email (not Gmail/Yahoo if possible) Full office address For international journals, at least some Editorial Board Members must be from reputed institutions abroad. Editorial Board members for scholarly journals should be senior faculty members (not students or research fellows). 3. Publication Rules The first issue must already be published online before applying for ISSN (no pre-ISSN for online publications). Each issue must contain: Minimum 5 articles for non-annual journals. Minimum 10 articles for annual journals. Each article must be uploaded as a separate webpage or separate hyperlink. Uploading the entire issue as one PDF is discouraged. 4. Content & Authenticity No plagiarism â€“ articles must be original. Journal should cover a precise subject or be targeted to a specific audience. Do not display misleading or false claims about: Indexing in databases Digital preservation membership Fake editorial board members Publisherâ€™s details Misleading info will lead to rejection or revocation of ISSN. 5. Technical & Display Requirements Clear navigation for: Home About Journal Editorial Board Current Issue / Archives Author Guidelines / Submission Rules Contact Us (with postal address in India) Each article should have: Title Author(s) with affiliation Abstract Keywords Full text (HTML/PDF, but hyperlink each article separately).
