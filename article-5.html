                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>
                        This review article explores recent advances in nanotechnology applications for targeted drug delivery systems. The study discusses novel nanocarriers and their potential for improving therapeutic efficacy while reducing side effects. We examine the latest developments in lipid nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, and carbon-based nanomaterials for drug delivery applications. The review covers design principles, functionalization strategies, targeting mechanisms, and clinical translation challenges. Current clinical trials demonstrate promising results for cancer therapy, gene delivery, and treatment of neurological disorders.

                    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Nanotechnology has revolutionized drug delivery by enabling precise control over drug release, targeting specific tissues, and overcoming biological barriers. The development of sophisticated nanocarriers has opened new possibilities for treating previously intractable diseases while minimizing systemic toxicity.
                    </p>

                    <h2>2. Nanocarrier Systems</h2>
                    <p>
                        Modern nanocarrier systems include liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and inorganic nanoparticles. Each system offers unique advantages in terms of drug loading capacity, stability, biocompatibility, and targeting capability. Recent innovations focus on stimuli-responsive systems that release drugs in response to specific environmental triggers.
                    </p>

                    <h2>3. Targeting Strategies</h2>
                    <p>
                        Advanced targeting strategies involve passive targeting through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and active targeting using ligands, antibodies, and aptamers. Multi-modal targeting approaches combining multiple mechanisms show improved specificity and therapeutic efficacy.
                    </p>

                    <h2>4. Clinical Applications</h2>
                    <p>
                        Current clinical applications demonstrate success in cancer chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and gene therapy. FDA-approved nanomedicines have shown improved therapeutic outcomes with reduced side effects compared to conventional formulations. Ongoing trials explore applications in neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disorders, and infectious diseases.
                    </p>

                    <h2>5. Future Perspectives</h2>
                    <p>
                        Future developments in nanomedicine focus on personalized therapy, combination treatments, and overcoming biological barriers. Emerging technologies include smart nanoparticles, biomimetic carriers, and AI-guided design approaches. Regulatory frameworks continue to evolve to address the unique challenges of nanomedicine development and clinical translation.
